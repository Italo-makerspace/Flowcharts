Flowcharts
==========

What is a Flowchart?
--------------------

A **flowchart** is a visual diagram that represents a process, workflow, or sequence of actions. It is used to describe and illustrate the flow of a process, clearly depicting the various steps and decisions involved. By using a flowchart, one can more easily comprehend how a system or process functions, identify potential bottlenecks or issues, and optimize its stages for greater efficiency.

Symbols and Their Meanings
--------------------------

Flowcharts use standardized symbols to represent different types of actions or operations. Here are the primary symbols used:

### 1\. Rectangle (Process)

-   Represents a specific step or action within the process.

-   **Example**: "Calculate the sum of two numbers."

### 2\. Diamond (Decision)

-   Used to represent a decision or a branching point in the process, where the outcome is typically a "yes" or "no."

-   **Example**: "Is the number greater than 10?"

### 3\. Circle (Connector)

-   Used to connect different parts of a flowchart, particularly when the diagram is large and spans multiple pages or sections.

-   **Example**: It can indicate that the flow continues in another part of the diagram.

### 4\. Parallelogram (Input/Output)

-   Represents data input (such as user-provided data) or the output of results.

-   **Example**: "Display the result on the screen."

### 5\. Arrows (Flow Lines)

-   Indicate the direction of flow between symbols, connecting the steps of the process.

Using Flowcharts in Systems Development
---------------------------------------

In systems development, flowcharts are essential for planning, visualizing, and optimizing processes, transforming abstract ideas into clear and efficient solutions. They assist in planning the internal workings of a system, facilitate the description and implementation of algorithms, identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies, and improve communication between technical and non-technical teams. Furthermore, with the use of emerging technologies like AI and automation, flowcharts can automatically generate code and adjust processes in real-time, accelerating development and driving innovation.

Other Examples of Flowcharts in Programming Logic
-------------------------------------------------

### Example 1: Flowchart to Determine if You Need Something

This flowchart illustrates whether you need a specific item and the process of searching for it.

This example uses a repetition structure (loop) to search for lost items.

### Example 2: Flowchart to Check if a Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero

This flowchart checks if a number provided by the user is positive, negative, or zero.

This example uses decision symbols (diamonds) to determine the category of the number.
